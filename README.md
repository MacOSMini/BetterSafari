Introduction

The main objective of BetterSafari is to mimic the browsing experience of Apple's Safari browser within a website environment. This means incorporating draggable iframes, smooth navigation, and a sleek design that aligns with the aesthetics of Apple's interface. By doing so, we aim to provide users with a familiar and enjoyable browsing experience while they remain on your website.
